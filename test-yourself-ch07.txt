1. "alt" and "src"
2. <img src="furry.jpg" alt="image of a ...">
3. make it accessible to screen readers and make it more understandable to browsers when they're not able to download/display the image file.
4. wrong tag wrapping, wrong path specified, unsupported format by the browser.
5. x descriptor uses the screen resolution/density as a parameter.
we use x descriptor for images that are static in different sites.
w descriptor, however, uses viewport (current browser window size), so it's better for images that resize according to browser windows.
6. a pixel can have different sizes depending on the device. a reference pixel can be based on multiple pixels to adjust and standardize pixel sizes.
7.

8. it tells the browser to adjust the image to 80% of the viewport width if the browser window has at least 480px (480px or more).
otherwise, it will display the image as 100% of the viewport width.
the srcset tells the browser what img to download based on the current viewport width in pixels.
and all of this will only be parsed by the browser if it supports the webp file type, as specified in the "type" tag.
if the browser doesn't support webp files, it downloads a .jpg image, also with responsive rules. 
the img element has the same rules of resizing and responsiveness as the source, which were discussed above.
9. cache is a space in the memory of the browsers that keeps files, images and other resources pre-downloaded to be used in the next time the user visits the same page. makes loading quicker.
10. one advantage is that it is pretty quick and simple to do this, however, we can't style the SVG this way.
11. advantage is that we can have a better manipulation of the SVG, but it can become a large piece of code, hard to maintain.
12. When it is purely presentational and not part of the editorial content of
the page.
13. image/svg+xml is the MIME type of an SVG file. You may need to include
it as the value of the type attribute in the picture element or use it to
configure your server to recognize SVG files as images.
